# iX Celebrates Birthdays

Here at iX, we like to put a lot of effort into celebrating our bestest buds' birthdays. Since everything in life should be made easier with Ruby on Rails, we've created a web application that is a complete birthday solution including custom pages, email forms for wishes and more! 

### Admin Privileges

While all users can see the birthdays list and individual birthday pages, only admins can create, edit, and delete birthdays from the website. In order to become an admin, do the following: 

1. Sign up for a GroupWish account at http://groupwish.herokuapp.com/admin
2. Click on 'Request Admin Privileges' to see a list of all the admins who are capable of granting you these privileges. 
3. Send one of them an email to login to their account and grant you the privileges. 
4. Enjoy the freedom to create, edit and delete birthdays on GroupWish!
