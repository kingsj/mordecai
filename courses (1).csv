In the 19th century, the distinction between past and future emerges from considerations of statistical processes. In the 20th century, the theory of relativity forces fundamental changes in the concept of time. Time ceases to be universal and becomes entangled with space and gravity.

We will look at how these religions have interacted with each other, as well as the ways in which they have been both influenced and been shaped by Korean culture and politics. We will also pay close attention to the ways in which Korea has developed its own distinctive religious traditions on the basis of active interactions with those of other countries: Korea was exposed to Buddhism, Confucianism, and Catholicism through China, as well as Protestantism which was brought directly from the West. We will explore how Koreans not only transformed these imported traditions and incorporated elements of their own indigenous traditions to meet their own religious needs, but also served as active agents or participants in the development, for example, of pan-East Asian religious traditions such as Hwaom",,,"Hours to be arranged",,

Using primary sources (that is, work written by black intellectuals rather than about them), the course engages the idea of a ""black radical tradition"". The black radical tradition is bound together as a set of ideas that constructs and reconstructs philosophical and political connections across the rupturing history of black dispossesssion, displacement, and disenfranchisement. The black radical tradition, then, exists in dialectical tension with many of the key idioms of Enlightenment and liberal philosophy (freedom, progress, history, justice, civilization). We pay particular attention to how the black radical tradition has framed the relationship of black history to modernity and global historical developments; how it has posited black selfhood and black liberation over and against attempts to conscript the end of slavery into a seamless narrative about the triumph of liberal values;",,,"Th., 2-4",,
